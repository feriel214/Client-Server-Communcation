Our project is done in an academic context . it's about client-Server communcations schemas.
the main goal of the app is the client generate a random number and based on that number the server will return an array with N length.
we implement : 
1-Named pipe communcation
2-TCP Socket communication
3-UDP Socket communication
The server treats the requests recieved in a parallel way using fork()
The clients process can be launched sequantially or parallel too thanks to fork()

This project was done by Feriel zarrouki and Wala Hammemi (2nd year engineer student at Higher Computer Science ISI ARIANA).
